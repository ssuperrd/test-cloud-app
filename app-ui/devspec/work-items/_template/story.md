# Work-Item Intake

Use this artifact for one work item or story at a time. Keep identity and routing in `meta.md`; keep decisions in `decisions.md`; keep implementation-ready scope in `finalize.md`.

## Change Requests

Use this section only for post-baseline scope changes after the work item reaches `finalized`, `tasks-planned`, `implementing`, `implemented`, `reviewing`, or `reviewed`. Append one row per accepted, rejected, superseded, or withdrawn request that is handled inside this work-item folder. Keep baseline story rows unchanged; add CR-scoped acceptance criteria and requirements to the existing tables with IDs such as `CR-001-AC-001`, `CR-001-FR-001`, and `CR-001-NFR-001`. If the user chooses a new linked work item, record the relationship in the linked item's `meta.md#work-item-record` `Parent work item` field instead of adding a `CR-###` row here.

| ID | Request | Relationship to baseline | Disposition | Source | Recorded |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CR-001 | <post-baseline-change-request> | related, user-confirmed append, or superseded by linked item | See `devspec/glossary.md#change-request-disposition-values` | user, provider, review, discovery | <yyyy-mm-dd-or-unknown> |

## Description

Record background, user or customer problem, affected scope, impact, and type-specific context. Keep repository access in `devspec/foundation/codebase-structure.md` and rules in `devspec/foundation/rules.md`.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Problem or opportunity | |
| User or customer impact | |
| Affected components | |
| Affected versions | |
| Type-specific context | |

## Acceptance Criteria

Record specific, testable conditions that must be true for completion. Use `AC-###` for baseline criteria and `CR-###-AC-###` for change-request criteria.

| ID | Criterion | Source | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC-001 |  | confirmed, provider, manual, user | pending |

## Functional Requirements

Record expected system behavior. Use `FR-###` for baseline requirements and `CR-###-FR-###` for change-request requirements.

| ID | Requirement | Source | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-001 |  | confirmed, provider, manual, user, discovery | open |

## Nonfunctional Requirements

Record quality attributes such as security, performance, reliability, accessibility, compliance, or scalability. Use `NFR-###` for baseline requirements and `CR-###-NFR-###` for change-request requirements.

| ID | Requirement | Source | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NFR-001 |  | foundation, intake, rule, user, discovery | open |

## Edge Cases

Record boundary conditions, failure paths, unusual states, and exception handling. Use `EDGE-###` for baseline cases and `CR-###-EDGE-###` for change-request cases.

| ID | Case | Source | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EDGE-001 |  | confirmed, provider, manual, user, discovery | open |

## Planning Signals

Record assumptions, dependencies, risks, blockers, type-specific facts, terms, and scope exclusions that affect clarification, finalization, planning, or validation. Omit low-impact notes and unused placeholder rows.

| Type | ID | Item | Source | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Assumption | ASM-001 |  | confirmed, inferred, user | open |
| Dependency | DEP-001 | <dependency-or-none> | intake, user, discovery | open |
| Multi-repo dependency | DEP-REPO-001 | yes, no; related repositories: <repository-names-only> | confirmed, user | open |
| Risk | RISK-001 |  | intake, user, discovery | open |
| Blocker | BLK-001 |  | intake, user, discovery | open |
