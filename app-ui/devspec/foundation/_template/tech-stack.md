# Technology Stack

Use this artifact for technology, version, support, hosting, and delivery facts that affect implementation or validation decisions.

## Stack Documentation Policy

| Policy area | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Evidence sources | Use manifests, lockfiles, framework config, CI config, infrastructure config, and docs as version evidence. |
| Discovery boundary | Do not inspect dependency folders, generated output, or excluded paths listed in `devspec/foundation/discovery-exclusions.md`. |
| Inventory scope | Use one stack inventory table per repository, deployable unit, or named project component. |
| Categories | Use clear categories such as `Language`, `Runtime`, `Framework`, `Library`, `Database`, `Service`, `Tooling`, `Hosting`, or `Delivery Constraint`. |
| Support status | Record support status from official release, lifecycle, or support pages when practical. |
| Unknown support | Use `no LTS channel`, `managed service`, or `unknown - needs lookup` instead of defaulting to `n/a`. |
| Not applicable support | Use `n/a` only when version support does not apply. |
| Verification date | Fill `Verified on` with the date the version or support status was checked. |
| Implementation impact | Include guidance when a technology affects coding, validation, hosting, compatibility, or support decisions. |
| Blocked facts | Record blocked stack, version, support, or hosting details as inventory rows with `blocked` confidence, the evidence gap, and the next action. |
| Row quality | Omit rows for technologies that are not confirmed, observed, inferred, or blocked by a specific evidence gap. |

## Support Lifecycle References

Maintain this lookup with official release, lifecycle, or support pages. Update these sources when a project uses a different vendor distribution or a better official endpoint becomes available.
