# Architecture Diagrams

Use this folder for optional durable Mermaid diagram artifacts, stored as Markdown files, that are more specific than the high-level architecture context in `devspec/architecture/overview.md`. SVG is the default generated diagram output and lives under `devspec/architecture/images/`; Mermaid is generated only when the requested output set includes `mermaid`, such as `format=mermaid`, `format=svg+mermaid`, `format=html+mermaid`, or `format=svg+html+mermaid`.

Store optional module, feature workflow, process-flow, user journey, sequence, state, class/domain, and cross-feature Mermaid diagrams as one Markdown file per subject only when the output set includes `mermaid`. Store durable SVG images under `devspec/architecture/images/dia-NNN-<diagram-name>.svg` by default and optional HTML under `devspec/architecture/html/dia-NNN-<diagram-name>.html`. Track proposed, generated, skipped, or blocked diagram work with evidence, confidence, output format, and tags in `devspec/architecture/artifact-queue.md`.

## File and Queue Naming

Use Title Case for diagram display names and lowercase sequence-prefixed kebab-case for subject slugs and filenames. Queue ID `DIA-001` maps to subject and file prefix `dia-001-`; for example, `DIA-001 - Order Fulfillment Flow` uses `devspec/architecture/diagrams/dia-001-order-fulfillment-flow.md`. Existing `DIA-*` numbers and `dia-NNN-*` files must not be renumbered.

Keep default subjects language-neutral after the sequence prefix, such as `dia-NNN-system-context`, `dia-NNN-runtime-containers`, `dia-NNN-dependency-graph`, or `dia-NNN-authentication-authorization-flow`. Use `dia-NNN-hybrid-user-to-data-operational-flow` for the durable hybrid flow that connects user entry points, application boundaries, services, data stores, validations, operational states, and outcomes.

Queue `Diagram type` records the logical diagram family only. Optional Mermaid artifacts record the full Mermaid declaration such as `flowchart LR`, `flowchart TD`, `sequenceDiagram`, `stateDiagram-v2`, or `erDiagram` when the selected output set includes `mermaid`.

`DIA-*` IDs, `dia-NNN-*` subjects, and `dia-NNN-*` filenames are durable diagram file and diagram queue naming conventions. They must not leak into Mermaid internal naming or SVG visible labels unless they are part of metadata outside the diagram content.

## Output Formats

- `/devspec.diagram <subject>` generates SVG by default.
- `/devspec.diagram format=mermaid <subject>` generates optional Markdown/Mermaid output.
- `/devspec.diagram format=html <subject>` generates optional standalone HTML output.
- Output sets can contain any non-duplicated `+` combination of `svg`, `html`, and `mermaid`, such as `format=svg+html`, `format=svg+mermaid`, `format=html+mermaid`, or `format=svg+html+mermaid`.
- Select SVG templates from `.github/prompts/PATTERNS.md#svg-output-pattern` when the output set includes `svg`, and validate generated SVG as XML before reporting success.

## Mermaid Readability

- Use simple internal names: short alphanumeric node IDs such as `AuthCtrl` or `ProviderSvc`, double-quoted node labels of 1-4 words such as `AuthCtrl["Authentication Controller"]`, and 2-3 word edge labels such as `-->|"API Calls"|`.
- Put interaction context on edge labels, not inside node labels.
- Do not use `\n` or `<br>` line breaks inside node labels or edge labels.

## Flowchart Scope

- Keep architectural flowcharts and graphs structurally unidirectional and adjacent by layer.
- Map dependency or invocation direction, such as UI -> API -> service -> repository -> database.
- Avoid cross-layer arrows that skip layers.
- Treat return paths as implied by downward invocation arrows.
- Keep each architectural flowchart focused on one primary business domain at macro level, not overloaded graphs or component internals.
- Do not use decision diamonds, if/else paths, validation loops, error branches, UI micro-interactions, HTTP return codes, validation exceptions, or database error returns unless the user explicitly requests an algorithm or activity flowchart.

## Sequence and Boundary Guidance

- Use `sequenceDiagram` when exact step-by-step request and response behavior is required.
- Show messages between distinct participants only.
- Default to the happy path, omit generic error `alt` or `opt` blocks unless requested, collapse pass-through API client helpers, and use method names such as `AuthenticateAsync(req)` for message labels.
- Keep runtime communication and compile-time project dependencies in separate diagrams; default to runtime or logical data flow unless the user explicitly requests a project dependency graph.
- Logical architecture diagrams must include only actual end users, client applications, runtime components, data stores, and external systems that interact with the live application.
- Exclude developers, maintainers, Git, CI/CD, deployment pipelines, build artifacts, and source-code project files unless the diagram is specifically about SDLC, build, deployment, or static project dependencies.
- Place databases owned and exclusively used by the application inside the system boundary.

## Detail to Avoid

Avoid API, tech stack, and framework bloat in generated Mermaid content. Do not put HTTP verbs, route templates, status codes, DTO or payload names, Swagger details, framework versions, specific library names, hosting models, or standard framework wiring into flowchart nodes unless the requested diagram is specifically about startup, request-pipeline, infrastructure-layer, or physical deployment behavior.
