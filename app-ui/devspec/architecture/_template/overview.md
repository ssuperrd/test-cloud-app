# Architecture Overview

Use this artifact for confirmed high-level architecture context, durable diagram references, ADR pointers, and unresolved architecture gaps. Keep detailed repository layout in `devspec/foundation/codebase-structure.md`, integration contracts in `devspec/foundation/codebase-structure.md#integration-contracts`, diagram queue state in `devspec/architecture/artifact-queue.md`, and full ADR content in ADR files created under `devspec/architecture/decisions/` when needed.

## Architecture Context

Use this section for confirmed architecture facts that affect system understanding across major components, integration relationships, runtime boundaries, and important data movement. Keep implementation file placement in `devspec/foundation/codebase-structure.md#work-areas-and-boundaries` and detailed contracts in `devspec/foundation/codebase-structure.md#integration-contracts`.

| Context type | Subject | Summary | Source | Confidence | Developer relevance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| component |  |  |  |  |  |
| integration |  |  |  |  |  |
| data-flow |  |  |  |  |  |

## Diagram Reference Index

Use this section for confirmed high-level diagrams in this file and links to durable detailed diagrams and optional SVG images. Do not mirror queue status here; track proposed, confirmed, generated, skipped, or blocked diagram work in `devspec/architecture/artifact-queue.md`.

| ID | Scope | Diagram type | Subject | Link or section | Usage notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | architecture, module, feature, workflow, user-journey | flowchart, sequenceDiagram, journey, stateDiagram, classDiagram, erDiagram |  | `devspec/architecture/images/dia-NNN-<diagram-name>.svg`, optional `devspec/architecture/diagrams/dia-NNN-<diagram-name>.md`, optional `devspec/architecture/html/dia-NNN-<diagram-name>.html`, or section anchor |  |

## Decision Reference Index

Use this section only for pointers to durable ADRs or confirmed architecture decisions. Keep metadata, context, outcome, impact, and references in the ADR file.

| Decision | Reference | Architecture relevance |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | `devspec/architecture/decisions/<adr-file>.md` |  |

## Architecture Gaps and Blockers

Use this section only for missing or conflicting architecture facts that prevent reliable planning, diagram generation, or architecture decision recording. Keep implementation blockers in work-item artifacts.
