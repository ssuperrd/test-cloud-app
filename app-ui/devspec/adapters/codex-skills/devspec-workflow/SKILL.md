# Devspec Workflow

Use this optional Codex skill as a starter template for repeated `devspec` workflows.

Before acting:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `devspec/adapters/command-registry.md` for the requested `/devspec.*` command.
3. Read the canonical `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` and `.github/agents/*.agent.md` files named by the registry.
4. Follow `AGENTS.md` for recovery, no-intent-drift, structured question behavior, and platform limitation handling.

Preserve artifact boundaries: product context belongs in `devspec/foundation/project-context.md`, durable principles in `devspec/constitution.md`, and operational governance or delivery gates in `devspec/foundation/rules.md`.

Do not assume Copilot prompt files register as Codex slash commands. Treat the command name as workflow intent unless the active Codex surface provides its own matching command mechanism.
