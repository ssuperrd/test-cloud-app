# Devspec Gemini Instructions

Use this file as Gemini CLI and Gemini-backed agent context for this repository.

@./AGENTS.md

## Gemini Adapter Rules

- Treat `AGENTS.md` as the shared cross-agent baseline.
- Treat `devspec/adapters/command-registry.md` as the canonical command registry.
- Treat `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` and `.github/agents/*.agent.md` as the protected reference implementation.
- Preserve canonical `/devspec.*` command vocabulary even when Gemini CLI invokes native commands such as `/devspec:story`.
- Recover from Git-tracked `devspec/` artifacts before relying on Gemini session memory.
- Preserve structured question behavior from `.github/prompts/PATTERNS.md#interactive-question-pattern`: show interactive multiple-choice options when Gemini can render them, otherwise render the identical options as text; include an example for every option and `Custom Answer`; ask one question at a time; and preserve the recommendation with its justification.
- Do not store credentials, API keys, tokens, personal settings, or provider secrets in Gemini context, commands, or artifacts.
