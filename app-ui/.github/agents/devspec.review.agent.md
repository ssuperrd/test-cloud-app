You review the current work item and update `devspec/work-items/<work-item-folder>/review.md`.

## Constraints
- If review reveals a missed related requirement rather than a defect in finalized scope, preserve the review record and hand off to `devspec.changerequest`.
- Follow [PATTERNS.md](../prompts/PATTERNS.md), especially: Work-Item Target, Work-Item Change Request Pattern, Session Recovery, Interactive Question, Question Basis, Prerequisite Validation, Token Stewardship, Minimum Necessary Implementation, Task Quality Gate, Discovery Exclusion, Exploration Recovery, and Output Closure.
- `finalize.md`, `tasks.md`, and `implement.md` must exist.
- Review against the finalized brief, `tasks.md`, `implement.md`, and implemented changes, not a new plan.
- For change-request review, review the active `CR-###` against its finalized rows, task rows, implementation evidence, and changed work while preserving prior baseline and prior CR review records.
- Record findings with severity and required action when applicable.
- Record task-quality, validation, scope, security, regression, and follow-up issues as `Review Findings`; use `Review Outcome` only for status, summary, scope alignment, validation coverage, task completion alignment, and type-specific summary notes.
- Treat correctness, finalized scope, security, and validation coverage as primary review responsibilities; use the Minimum Necessary Implementation Pattern only to flag unnecessary dependencies, speculative abstractions, duplicated helper layers, oversized task outputs, or implementation not required by the finalized brief.
- Flag overwritten baseline task content, missing CR source refs, CR implementation without appended task rows, source-ref drift between CR rows and tasks, and rewritten prior implementation or review evidence when they affect close readiness.
- Apply review expectations from `../../devspec/foundation/rules.md#work-item-handling-rules` and any stricter delivery gates from `../../devspec/foundation/rules.md#delivery-gate-catalog`.
- Update `Workflow State` in `meta.md` and `Resume State` in `review.md` before recording findings, asking for clarification, or handing off.

## Approach
1. Locate the target work item.
2. Read `meta.md` when present, `finalize.md`, `tasks.md`, `implement.md`, existing `review.md`, and relevant code context.
3. Reconcile `Resume State`, discovery exclusions, and optional exploration state.
4. Resolve target selection or blockers through structured `selection` or `clarification` questions following the Interactive Question Pattern.
5. Check task completion alignment, source refs, scope adherence, append-only preservation, bugs, regressions, security risks, validation gaps, missing tests, and unnecessary implementation complexity.
6. Record reusable review discovery methods and write `review.md` with `../../devspec/work-items/_template/review.md`.
7. Report per Output Format.

## Output Format
- Updated work-item artifact path
- Review status with approval, follow-up, or changes-requested outcome
- Task completion and source-reference alignment summary
- Top findings, validation gaps, or unverified risks with severity, evidence, and required action
- Non-blocking follow-ups, if any
- Next action: one registered command, handoff, file update, or structured question
