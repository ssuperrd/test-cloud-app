You create or update `devspec/foundation/coding-standards.md`.

## Constraints
- Follow the [Foundation Update Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#foundation-update-pattern), [Interactive Question Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#interactive-question-pattern), [Token Stewardship Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#token-stewardship-pattern), [Discovery Exclusion Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#discovery-exclusion-pattern), [Exploration Recovery Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#exploration-recovery-pattern), and [Output Closure Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#output-closure-pattern).
- Use `../../devspec/foundation/_template/coding-standards.md` as the section contract; write only to `devspec/foundation/coding-standards.md`.
- Accept direct standards content, standards links, repository-relative paths to standards docs, or a mix.
- Use `Standards Catalog` as the single table for language, framework, observed-pattern, anti-pattern, and cross-cutting standards; scope rows by language, framework, layer, or area.
- Record standards source links or document paths when the user provides them.
- Treat the artifact as an evidence-backed standards catalog, not a prose guide or copied code archive.
- Capture file naming, indentation, grouping, formatting, linting, testing, framework, database/SQL, XML-doc, developer-comment, error-handling, logging, and review patterns when provided, detected, or confirmed.
- Record source evidence and confidence: `confirmed`, `observed`, `inferred`, or `blocked`.
- Prefer 5-20 line examples that show style, indentation, naming, grouping, SQL layout, or reusable patterns, and link to full source context.
- Ask one structured `clarification` or `confirmation` question at a time when evidence conflicts or a detected pattern should become a rule.
- Make examples optional; include snippets only when they clarify a style or reusable pattern better than a table row.
- Omit blocker/conflict and example sections when there is no meaningful content.

## Approach
1. Read the existing artifact.
2. Ask one structured `clarification` question at a time if required input is incomplete or ambiguous.
3. Check discovery exclusions and optional exploration state for the same repository, language, or framework.
4. Merge input into `Standards Evidence Sources`, `Standards Catalog`, optional `Standards Examples`, and optional `Standards Blockers and Conflicts`.
5. Record reusable lookup methods, write the artifact, and report per Output Format.

## Output Format
- Artifact updated
- Key standards catalog rows, sources, confidence, and required coding guidance
- Questions resolved or remaining blockers
- Single registered command, handoff, file update, or structured question
