You create or update `devspec/work-items/<work-item-folder>/finalize.md`.

## Constraints
- Follow the [Work-Item Target Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#work-item-target-pattern), [Work-Item Change Request Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#work-item-change-request-pattern), [Session Recovery Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#session-recovery-pattern), [Interactive Question Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#interactive-question-pattern), [Question Basis Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#question-basis-pattern), [Prerequisite Validation Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#prerequisite-validation-pattern), [Readiness Gap Scan Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#readiness-gap-scan-pattern), [Explore and Memory Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#explore-and-memory-pattern), [Multi-Repo Validation Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#multi-repo-validation-pattern), [Token Stewardship Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#token-stewardship-pattern), [Discovery Exclusion Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#discovery-exclusion-pattern), [Exploration Recovery Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#exploration-recovery-pattern), and [Output Closure Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#output-closure-pattern).
- Required upstream artifacts must exist before finalization; use `story.md#summary`, `story.md#change-requests`, `story.md#description`, `story.md#acceptance-criteria`, `story.md#functional-requirements`, `story.md#nonfunctional-requirements`, `story.md#edge-cases`, and `story.md#planning-signals` as the source for intake narrative, change requests, requirements, acceptance criteria, dependencies, type-specific notes, risks, and blockers.
- Read `decisions.md` when present; use accepted work-item decisions as scope, planning, validation, rollout, or handoff inputs by referencing their `DEC-*` IDs.
- When finalizing an accepted change request, set `Resume State` `Current item` to the active `CR-###` and append CR-scoped readiness, implementation brief, validation plan, and blocker rows. Preserve prior baseline and prior CR rows.
- Run the Readiness Gap Scan before setting `finalize.md` to `ready`.
- Set `Readiness Assessment` status to `ready` only when every required readiness gate is `ready` or `not applicable`; otherwise set it to `not ready`.
- Mark the brief `not ready` while blockers remain or required repository access, foundation alignment, architecture alignment, compliance handling, or validation expectations are missing, ambiguous, conflicting, or unconfirmed.
- Apply readiness gates and type-specific requirements from `../../devspec/foundation/rules.md`.
- Check applicable alignment sources before readiness: `../../devspec/constitution.md`, `../../devspec/foundation/project-context.md`, `../../devspec/foundation/tech-stack.md`, `../../devspec/foundation/codebase-structure.md`, `../../devspec/foundation/coding-standards.md`, `../../devspec/foundation/rules.md`, `../../devspec/architecture/overview.md`, and relevant `../../devspec/architecture/decisions/*.md` files when their scope intersects the work item.
- Block on conflicts with durable principles, product scope, stack or support constraints, repository boundaries, coding standards, delivery gates, architecture decisions, or unresolved architecture gaps that would materially change scope, task decomposition, validation design, repository readiness, delivery risk, compliance handling, or type-specific rule handling.
- Record material foundation, standards, delivery-gate, validation, and architecture constraints in `Implementation Brief` by source path, section, row ID, or decision ID; do not duplicate full foundation or architecture content.
- Ensure every acceptance criterion, type-specific requirement, delivery gate, and material risk has validation coverage in `Validation Plan` or a blocking reason before marking `ready`.
- For multi-repo work, record only repository readiness summary in `Implementation Brief`, including required repositories and whether access is confirmed, missing, or blocked; keep local paths and access requirement values in `../../devspec/foundation/codebase-structure.md`.
- Do not invent missing requirements or silently change scope.
- Do not rewrite baseline readiness, implementation brief, validation plan, or blocker rows to fit later change-request scope.
- Use `Explore` when implementation context, analogous behavior, or impact areas need quick discovery.
- Use session memory only for transient notes; `finalize.md` remains canonical.
- Update `Workflow State` in `meta.md` and `Resume State` in `finalize.md` before marking `not ready`, asking for clarification, or handing off.
- Keep `finalize.md` implementation-oriented: readiness gates, implementation brief, validation plan, and blockers.
- Do not create a separate command or readiness/alignment artifact for this stage; preserve required `meta.md` workflow-state updates and keep readiness evidence in `finalize.md`.
- Evaluate readiness gates as specific checks for scope, acceptance criteria, dependencies or repository readiness, type-specific requirements, and validation or delivery risk. Record Readiness Gap Scan outcomes through these readiness gates and `Implementation Brief` rows, not as a separate speculative audit artifact.
- When the scan finds any blocking gap, choose the highest-impact and highest-uncertainty gap as the active blocker, set readiness to `not ready`, record the blocking action in `Readiness Assessment`, update `meta.md` and `finalize.md` resume state, and hand off to `/devspec.clarify`.
- Before surfacing a readiness blocker or structured question, apply the Question Basis Pattern.
- Use `Implementation Brief` as the single source for implementation scope, acceptance criteria, assumptions, constraints, dependencies, target-area facts, repository readiness summaries, type-specific requirements, delivery risks, and handoff follow-ups.
- Keep acceptance criteria focused on what must be true; keep validation commands, review methods, and expected proof in `Validation Plan`.
- Do not duplicate the same fact across sections; prefer the section whose purpose matches the fact and point other sections to it by ID or source.
- Omit optional sections when they do not affect implementation, validation, or handoff.

## Approach
1. Locate the target work item.
2. Read `meta.md` when present, `decisions.md` when present, required upstream artifacts, and applicable foundation and architecture alignment sources.
3. Reconcile `Resume State`, discovery exclusions, and optional exploration state.
4. Use `Explore` when needed; persist meaningful discovery notes and unresolved assumptions before asking or writing.
5. Run the Readiness Gap Scan for the current item (`baseline` or active `CR-###`), including foundation and architecture alignment, and map material gaps into readiness gates, `Implementation Brief`, `Validation Plan`, or blockers.
6. Resolve target selection or blockers through structured `selection` or `clarification` questions following the Interactive Question Pattern; use `/devspec.clarify` for the top blocking ambiguity when a separate clarification handoff is needed.
7. Apply type-specific readiness gates and write `finalize.md` with `../../devspec/work-items/_template/finalize.md`.
8. Report per Output Format.

## Output Format
- Work-item path updated
- Ready status
- Key scope, foundation or architecture alignment, readiness, validation, and blocker changes
- Blockers or next step
- Single registered command, handoff, file update, or structured question
