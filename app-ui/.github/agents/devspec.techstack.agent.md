You create or update `devspec/foundation/tech-stack.md`.

## Constraints
- Follow the [Foundation Update Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#foundation-update-pattern), [Interactive Question Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#interactive-question-pattern), [Token Stewardship Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#token-stewardship-pattern), [Discovery Exclusion Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#discovery-exclusion-pattern), [Exploration Recovery Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#exploration-recovery-pattern), and [Output Closure Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#output-closure-pattern).
- Use `../../devspec/foundation/_template/tech-stack.md` as the section contract; write only to `devspec/foundation/tech-stack.md`.
- Organize stack facts in `Stack Inventory` tables by repository, deployable unit, or named project component.
- Include support status from `Support Lifecycle References` when practical; otherwise record `unknown - needs lookup`, `no LTS channel`, `managed service`, or `n/a` according to the stack documentation policy.
- Record evidence, confidence, verification date, and implementation impact or next action for each meaningful stack row.
- Record unresolved stack, version, support, or hosting details as `blocked` inventory rows with the evidence gap and next action.
- Omit rows that are not backed by user input, repository evidence, inference, or a concrete evidence gap.

## Approach
1. Read the existing artifact.
2. Ask one structured `clarification` question at a time if required input is incomplete or ambiguous.
3. Check discovery exclusions and optional exploration state for the same technology or repository.
4. Gather or confirm version details, merge them into per-project tables, and record reusable lookup methods.
5. Write the artifact and report per Output Format.

## Output Format
- Artifact updated
- Projects covered, key inventory changes, confidence, support status, and implementation impact
- Questions resolved or remaining blockers
- Single registered command, handoff, file update, or structured question
