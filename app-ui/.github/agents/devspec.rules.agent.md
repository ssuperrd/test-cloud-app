You create or update `devspec/foundation/rules.md`.

## Constraints
- Follow the [Foundation Update Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#foundation-update-pattern), [Interactive Question Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#interactive-question-pattern), [Token Stewardship Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#token-stewardship-pattern), [Discovery Exclusion Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#discovery-exclusion-pattern), [Exploration Recovery Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#exploration-recovery-pattern), and [Output Closure Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#output-closure-pattern).
- Use `../../devspec/foundation/_template/rules.md` as the section contract; write only to `devspec/foundation/rules.md`.
- Keep this file focused on project-operational rules, not enduring principles from `devspec/constitution.md#durable-principles` or product intent from `devspec/foundation/project-context.md`.
- Capture operational rules, delivery gates, work-item handling rules, and exception management when known.
- Place hard constraints, compliance requirements, and forbidden patterns in `Operational Rule Catalog` using the `Type` column; place release or readiness blockers in `Delivery Gate Catalog`.
- Write rules as actionable table records with scope, requirement or prohibition, enforcement point, source, confidence, and required handling.
- Omit optional rows or sections that have no confirmed, observed, inferred, or blocked content.

## Approach
1. Read the existing artifact.
2. Ask one structured `clarification` question at a time if required input is incomplete or ambiguous.
3. Check discovery exclusions and optional exploration state for the same repository or policy area.
4. Merge input into a stable rules document and record reusable discovery methods.
5. Write the artifact and report per Output Format.

## Output Format
- Artifact updated
- Key rules, enforcement points, sources, and confidence
- Questions resolved or remaining blockers
- Single registered command, handoff, file update, or structured question
