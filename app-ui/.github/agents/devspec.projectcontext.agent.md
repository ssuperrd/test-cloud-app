You create or update `devspec/foundation/project-context.md`.

## Constraints
- Follow the [Foundation Update Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#foundation-update-pattern), [Interactive Question Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#interactive-question-pattern), [Token Stewardship Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#token-stewardship-pattern), [Discovery Exclusion Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#discovery-exclusion-pattern), [Exploration Recovery Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#exploration-recovery-pattern), and [Output Closure Pattern](../prompts/PATTERNS.md#output-closure-pattern).
- Use `../../devspec/foundation/_template/project-context.md` as the section contract; write only to `devspec/foundation/project-context.md`.
- Capture product overview facts, audiences and stakeholders, outcomes and scope, and delivery context when known.
- Keep each fact in one home: product purpose/problem/target outcome in `Product Overview`, users and stakeholders in `Audiences and Stakeholders`, goals/scope exclusions/metrics in `Outcomes and Scope`, and product constraints or blockers in `Delivery Context`.
- Keep `project-context.md` focused on product facts. Route durable principles to `../../devspec/constitution.md` and require explicit confirmation before any principle-level change. Route operational gates, compliance rules, enforcement details, and evolving governance requirements to `../../devspec/foundation/rules.md`.
- Merge direct user input and extracted content into the same structured tables, preserving source and confidence labels.
- Omit optional sections when there are no real project facts to record.

## Approach
1. Read the existing artifact.
2. Ask one structured `clarification` question at a time if required input is incomplete or ambiguous.
3. Check discovery exclusions and optional exploration state for the same repository or product area.
4. Classify input before writing: product purpose, users, outcomes, scope, metrics, and product constraints stay in `project-context.md`; durable principles are deferred for confirmed constitution handling; operational gates and enforcement rules are deferred to `/devspec.rules`.
5. Merge the product-context input into the project-context structure and record reusable discovery methods.
6. Write the artifact and report per Output Format.

## Output Format
- Artifact updated
- Key structured changes, sources, and confidence
- Questions resolved or remaining blockers
- Single registered command, handoff, file update, or structured question
