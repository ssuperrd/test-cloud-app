You create or update `devspec/work-items/<work-item-folder>/tasks.md`.

## Constraints
- Follow [PATTERNS.md](../prompts/PATTERNS.md), especially: Work-Item Target, Work-Item Change Request Pattern, Session Recovery, Interactive Question, Question Basis, Prerequisite Validation, Explore and Memory, Multi-Repo Validation, Token Stewardship, Minimum Necessary Implementation, Task Quality Gate, Discovery Exclusion, Exploration Recovery, and Output Closure.
- `finalize.md` must exist and be marked `ready`.
- Do not change or expand the finalized scope.
- For change-request planning, plan only the active `CR-###` recorded in `Resume State` or finalized source refs. Append new task rows after the highest existing `T-###`; do not regenerate, renumber, remove, or rewrite existing task rows.
- Every task row must record `Scope` as `baseline` or the active `CR-###`.
- Assign multi-repo tasks only to configured repositories whose access requirements support the planned work.
- For monorepos, keep the work item as the orchestration boundary and distinguish executable tasks by target area, module, layer, or validation surface.
- Use `reference-only` repositories for context only; surface a blocker when required repository access is missing, ambiguous, unconfirmed, or insufficient for needed edits or validation.
- Apply planning requirements from `../../devspec/foundation/rules.md#work-item-handling-rules`.
- Use `Explore` for quick discovery of impacted code paths, analogous implementations, or verification surfaces.
- Use session memory only for transient dependency mapping, open questions, and decomposition notes.
- Update `Workflow State` in `meta.md` and `Resume State` in `tasks.md` before recording a blocker, asking for clarification, or handing off.
- Apply the Task Quality Gate Pattern when writing `Task Quality Review` and source-referenced `Implementation Tasks`.
- Default to 3-5 executable tasks for ordinary work items; use fewer for narrow changes and more only when repository boundaries, dependencies, validation surfaces, or finalized scope require it.
- Merge planned tasks that target the same area and share the same validation unless separate checkpoints materially improve recovery or review.
- Do not create standalone refactor, dependency, abstraction, cleanup, or future-proofing tasks unless `finalize.md` requires them.
- Every task row must name scope, source refs, a concrete target area or files, a specific validation method, an observable done condition, and dependency order.
- Use `finalize.md#implementation-brief` as the source for implementation scope, acceptance criteria, planning inputs, multi-repo readiness, type-specific requirements, risks, and follow-ups; use `finalize.md#validation-plan` for validation methods.
- Do not copy finalized dependencies, repository lists, or validation methods into `Planning Basis`; record source references there and put executable details on the task rows that use them.
- Use `Implementation Tasks` as the single table for ordered tasks, likely impacted areas, validation, and done criteria.

## Approach
1. Locate the target work item.
2. Read `meta.md` when present, `finalize.md`, existing `tasks.md`, and relevant foundation artifacts.
3. Reconcile `Resume State`, discovery exclusions, and optional exploration state.
4. Use `Explore` when needed; persist meaningful discovery notes, dependency mapping, and unresolved questions before asking or writing.
5. Resolve target selection or blockers through structured `selection` or `clarification` questions following the Interactive Question Pattern.
6. Apply the Task Quality Gate Pattern; block or ask one structured question for material planning gaps.
7. Apply type-specific planning rules and write repository-aware tasks with `../../devspec/work-items/_template/tasks.md`, appending change-request task rows when the current item is `CR-###`.
8. Report per Output Format.

## Output Format
- Updated work-item artifact path
- Task quality review result, including any coverage, validation, dependency, or blocker gaps
- Planned task summary with key task IDs, target areas, validation methods, and done criteria
- Open blockers or assumptions that affect implementation
- Next action: one registered command, handoff, file update, or structured question
