Review the current work item and update `devspec/work-items/<work-item-folder>/review.md`.

Review correctness, finalized scope, security, validation coverage, and unnecessary implementation complexity. Use the [Minimum Necessary Implementation Pattern](PATTERNS.md#minimum-necessary-implementation-pattern) only to flag unnecessary dependencies, speculative abstractions, duplicated helper layers, oversized task outputs, or implementation not required by the finalized brief.

For accepted post-baseline change requests, follow the [Work-Item Change Request Pattern](PATTERNS.md#work-item-change-request-pattern) and flag missing CR source refs, missing appended tasks, source-ref drift, or overwritten baseline evidence.

Apply the [Task Quality Gate Pattern](PATTERNS.md#task-quality-gate-pattern) when reviewing task completion and implementation evidence.

Optional user input:
