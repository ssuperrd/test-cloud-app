name: devspec-diagram
description: Run /devspec.diagram using the canonical devspec command registry. Generates evidence-backed diagrams, defaulting to SVG with optional Mermaid and HTML output, for architecture, workflows, journeys, sequences, states, timelines, and planning views. Supports mono-repo and multi-repo workspaces. Works across GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, and other AI agents.

Execute canonical command `/devspec.diagram`.

1. Read `AGENTS.md` for canonical workflow, no-intent-drift, cross-tool recovery, and structured question rules.
2. Read `devspec/adapters/command-registry.md` for this command's required input, outputs, mutation level, and next handoff.
3. Read `.github/prompts/devspec.diagram.prompt.md` and `.github/agents/devspec.diagram.agent.md` as the authoritative source of command intent and behavior.
4. Apply `.github/prompts/PATTERNS.md` for shared behavior: interactive questions, prerequisite validation, session recovery, discovery exclusions, and output closure, including `PATTERNS.md#diagram-extraction-consistency-pattern`, `PATTERNS.md#svg-output-pattern`, `PATTERNS.md#mermaid-internal-naming-and-readability-pattern`, `PATTERNS.md#mermaid-visual-quality-pattern`, `PATTERNS.md#process-flow-extraction-pattern`, and `PATTERNS.md#excluded-diagram-families`.
5. Treat SVG as the default output. Pass through any non-duplicated `format=` combination of `svg`, `html`, and `mermaid`; examples include `format=svg`, `format=html`, `format=mermaid`, `format=svg+html`, `format=svg+mermaid`, `format=svg+html+mermaid`, and `format=html+mermaid`. Unsupported or duplicated `format=` values require clarification.
6. For every generated Mermaid `flowchart` or `stateDiagram-v2`: open with the dark theme init block, declare the semantic `classDef` palette for roles present, use role-appropriate node shapes, wrap boundaries of 3+ nodes in named `subgraph` blocks, draw cross-subgraph arrows after all `end` keywords, assign `classDef` classes in a batch block at the end, and verify node count stays within complexity guardrails. Never use an excluded family such as `architecture-beta`; substitute the documented portable alternative.
7. For SVG output, use `devspec/architecture/_template/process-flow-diagram.svg` for process-flow rows or explicit process-flow SVG requests, otherwise use `devspec/architecture/_template/architecture-diagram.svg`. Write durable images under `devspec/architecture/images/`, and validate generated SVG as standalone XML with no scripts, iframes, foreignObject, external assets, secrets, or unresolved placeholders.
8. Honor multi-repo boundaries: when `devspec/foundation/codebase-structure.md` records multiple repositories, scope diagram evidence to the correct repository boundary.

Command input comes from the user's current message.

Platform note: Claude Code may not register `/devspec.diagram` as a native slash command. Treat the command name as workflow intent and use this skill as the invocation mechanism. Record any unsupported behavior in `devspec/adapters/compatibility-matrix.md`.
