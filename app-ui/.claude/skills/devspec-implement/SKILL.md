name: devspec-implement
description: Run /devspec.implement using the canonical devspec command registry. The only code-write command - edits target repository code when the upstream work item and repository access allow it. Supports mono-repo and multi-repo workspaces. Works across GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, and other AI agents.

Execute canonical command `/devspec.implement`.

1. Read `AGENTS.md` for canonical workflow, no-intent-drift, cross-tool recovery, and structured question rules.
2. Read `devspec/adapters/command-registry.md` for this command's required input, outputs, mutation level (`code-write`), and next handoff.
3. Read `.github/prompts/devspec.implement.prompt.md` and `.github/agents/devspec.implement-task.agent.md` as the authoritative source of command intent and behavior.
4. Apply `.github/prompts/PATTERNS.md` for shared behavior: interactive questions, prerequisite validation, session recovery, discovery exclusions, and output closure.
5. Honor multi-repo boundaries: when `devspec/foundation/codebase-structure.md` records multiple repositories, every implementation task must name the target repository and required access level before writing any code.

Command input comes from the user's current message.

Platform note: Claude Code may not register `/devspec.implement` as a native slash command. Treat the command name as workflow intent and use this skill as the invocation mechanism. This command requires `code-write` access - confirm repository permissions before proceeding. Record any unsupported behavior in `devspec/adapters/compatibility-matrix.md`.
